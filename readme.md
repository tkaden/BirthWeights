# Predict Birth Weights

This is used to predict the weight of a newborn child. Inspired by a round of bets my family made regarding the weight and time of birth our future cousin.

## Data

The data was gathered from the [CDC Website](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/vitalstatsonline.htmhttps://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/vitalstatsonline.html). On the website, you'll find a flat file (around 5gb) and a pdf file that outlines how the data is interpreted.

The most difficult part of this project is dealing with a 5 gb file with no formatting other than a pdf explaining which position in a string corresponds to each variable.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r req.txt
```

## Run
